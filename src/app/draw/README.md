# src/app/draw

These files used to be in the :file_folder: **models** folder, but they **DO** stuff.  These classes use the models and draw to the canvas' context.  They should get their **own** folder.

* :file_folder: **fractals**
* :file_folder: **interfaces**
* :file_folder: **primitives**

*This is evolutionary and we'll see how this works out.*
