# src/app/components/drawing

For now the animation is done in these components and will most likely move somewhere else once it's generic.
All the collision code is in the `fishbowl.component` at the moment.
Not a **great** place for it, but it'll do for now.

* :page_facing_up: `animationControls`
* :page_facing_up: `drawing`
* :page_facing_up: `fishbowl`

*This is evolutionary and we'll see how this works out.*
