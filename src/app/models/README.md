# src/app/models

The files in **models** contain fairly dumb classes.  They are basically to facilitate the structure and data of more complete graphical objects.  At the moment there are only 2D objects, but hopefully with the interfaces it will be easy to switch from 2D to 3D fairly easily.  No need to carry the extra weight of an additional dimension if you don't need to.

* :file_folder: **interfaces**
* :file_folder: **transform**

*This is evolutionary and we'll see how this works out.*
